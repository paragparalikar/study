### Practical Observations  
 1. Prices cyclic in nature
 2. Prices are fractal in nature

### Wyckoffian Theory
 1. Prices move because of imbalance in demand and supply
 2. Individual traders are not organized thus can not cause significant supply/demand imbalance any one direction, thus it has to be organized big players who accumulate/distribute stock to cause such big imbalance.
 3. Big players obviously have to buy/sell in such huge quantities that that either shows in volume spikes or stopping of existing trends.

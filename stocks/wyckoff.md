## Practical Observations  
 1. 4 diamentions of charts - price, time, volume, volatility
 2. Prices cyclic in nature
 3. Prices are fractal in nature
 
1. preliminary support
2. exhaustion move
3. price rejection
4. volume climaxes
5. dry moves
6. Overshoots and undershoots
7. Jumps
8. Resistance line with secondary peaks
9. Support line
10. No supply shakeouts (THE biggest bullish indicator)
11. Springs and Tests
12. Volatility cycles, volatility squeeze and median line
13. Very high volume up moves and high momentum down moves showing supply

14. congestion zones as support/resistance
15. flag measured move as reversal pre-conditions
16. volume difference(drying volume as decreasing supply)
17. Breakouts

## Wyckoffian Theory
 1. Prices move because of imbalance in demand and supply
 2. Individual traders are not organized thus can not cause significant supply/demand imbalance in any one direction, thus it has to be organized big players who accumulate/distribute stock to cause such big imbalance.
 3. Big players obviously have to buy/sell in such huge quantities that that either shows in volume spikes or stopping of existing trends.
 4. Big players, specially market makers have unfair advantage of being able to see everyone's stop losses and pending orders. Thus they use that information to their advantage by using "stop fishing". This causes phenomenon we call "tests".
 5. As big players have enough monetary reserves, they can temporarily go against their own intended price direction to force individual traders to sell their holdings. This causes phenonmenons we call "shakeouts" and "springs"
 6. As accumulation matures, there is less and less free floating stock available. Thus volume and price volatility decreases accordingly, creating a volatility squeeze.
 
 ## Accumulation events
 1. Weak downtrend
 2. Preliminary support
 3. Price rejection(aka selling climax)
 4. Auto rally
 5. Shakeout
 6. Downtrend broken
 7. Sign of strength ie strong bull moves
 8. Volatility squeeze
 9. Spring and/or Test
 10. Intermediate downtrend broken
 
 ## Stop loss
 Low of spring or the latest test is used as stop loss. This stop loss has to be honoured unconditionally. Even if it turns out to be a trap, we can always enter at upcoming entry points.
 
 ## Entry Points
 1. Break of latest intermediate downtrend
 2. Break of current short term accumulation/consolidation
    Break of downtrend of second leg of short term double bottom
    
 ## Practical checklist for short term trading
 1. Positive momentum delta
 2. Downtrend has been broken
 3. Volatility is decreased
 4. Spring/Test has occured

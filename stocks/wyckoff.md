### Practical Observations  
 1. Prices cyclic in nature
 2. Prices are fractal in nature

### Wyckoffian Theory
 1. Prices move because of imbalance in demand and supply
 2. Individual traders are not organized thus can not cause significant supply/demand imbalance in any one direction, thus it has to be organized big players who accumulate/distribute stock to cause such big imbalance.
 3. Big players obviously have to buy/sell in such huge quantities that that either shows in volume spikes or stopping of existing trends.
 4. Big players, specially market makers have unfair advantage of being able to see everyone's stop losses and pending orders. Thus they use that information to their advantage by using "stop fishing". This causes phenomenon we call "tests".
 5. As big players have enough monetary reserves, they can temporarily go against their own intended price direction to force individual traders to sell their holdings. This causes phenonmenons we call "shakeouts" and "springs"
 6. As accumulation matures, there is less and less free floating stock is available. Thus volume and price volatility decreases accordingly.

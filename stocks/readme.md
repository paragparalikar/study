## How to draw a "real" resistance/support line (not a trend line) ? 
It has been practically and consistently seen that the traditional method of drawing support/resistance lines is deeply flawed.  
Traditionally resistance line is drawn by connecting two or more highest highs, such that there is no price beyond the resistance line.  
Thought process behind drawing resistance line this way is that if price goes beyond this line, it could be treated as break of this line.  
But if we take breakouts this way it is too late to enter. Most of our profits have been evaporated and stop loss is too far away to have a reasonable RR ratio. 
Hence after observing multiple charts below method of drawing resistance line is being adopted:

1. Exhaustion moves of secondary cycles should be beyond resistance line  
1. Resistance line should be drawn using spikes and high volume bar closes  
2. Resistance line must touch highest high of most recent mini cycles




## Aspects for short term trading

1. Higher term trend
2. Momentum delta
3. Oversold level
4. Price rejection
5. Divergences
6. Volatility squeeze
7. Support/Resistence
8. Spring/Test
9. Entry bar

## Indicators for different use cases
Trend: Moving Averages, Aroon
Occilators: RSI, Stochastics, MACD
Volume: OBV
Volatility: ATR, Bollinger Bands width

## Support
__Options__ / __Bullish__  / __Short Term__
1. Uptrend on daily chart
2. Positive momentum delta on daily timeframe
3. Support on daily timeframe -> Ref to details for how to determine support on daily charts
4. Preliminary support on 30 min chart
5. Price rejection on 30 mins chart
6. Positive momentum delta on 30 min chart
7. Volatility crunch on 5 min chart
8. Spring/Test on 5 min chart
9. squeeze-break bar on 5 min chart



## Climax - Support break
__Options__ / __Bearish__  / __Short Term__
1. Daily chart - Overbought region (Bollinger, RSI)
2. Daily chart - Exhaustion move (Uptrend line) - This is also means overbought region
3. Daily chart - Buying climax with very high volume
4. Daily chart - Divergence (Bollinger, RSI) - Preferable but Optional in case of very clear Buying climax (Switch to hourly chart next day)
5. Hourly chart - Weak uptrend broken

## Squeeze - Resistance break
__Equity__ / __Bullish__ / __Medium Term__
1. Positive momentum delta
2. Uptrend in higher time frame
3. Weak intermediate down trend line (using spike with overshoots)
4. Low volatility ie squeeze (Low standard deviation) close to the weak down trend line
5. Breakout bar with that closes out of downtrend line resistance

## Bull Flag
__Equity__ / __Bullish__ / __Medium Term__
1. Uptrend on daily chart
2. Flag pole high does not show buying climax of entire uptrend
3. Flag end fills runway gaps. Flag end overlaps the long spread bars with high volume. These bars can internally have runway gaps. Both of these entities ie runway gaps and strong up bars represent the same principle of extremely strong move. 
4. Flag end coincides with simple moving average. Span of this SMA is difference between flag pole start and flag end. This is flag version of

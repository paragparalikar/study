The One Thing

The world around us is exponencial in nature; NOT liner
(Also exponencial effect of available information on success of any endevour)
Hard work wont bring you success, but smart work will

We remember by seeing, and learn by doing(in case of children copying which is doing after seeing)
Decisions are made based on emotions not logic
